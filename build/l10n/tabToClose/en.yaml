SectionName_UI: UI
SectionDescription_UI: |-
  - Select UI mode to close when you press the chosen key in the {SectionName_CloseKey} section.
  - OpenMW 4.9 does not allow for detecting what window is open, but does allow for detecting what mode is. The "Interface" mode includes the inventory window.
    - So if "interface" is set to true, and the close key is pressed, the interface mode will close (which includes the inventory window).

# You can overwrite the name of any UI setting by placing it here: Just prefix it with "SettingsUI_"
# Example: 
# SettingsUI_Interface: Interface
