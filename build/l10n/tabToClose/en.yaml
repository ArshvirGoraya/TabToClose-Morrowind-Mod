ModName: Tab To Close
ModDescription: |-
  Force close chosen UI with chosen Key.

  - Originally made for the tab key, which can get stuck in search bar, text line inputs, or get stuck cycling through UI elements, disallowing you to use it to close the certain UI.

SectionName_CloseKey: Close Key
SectionDescription_CloseKey: |-
  Which key to use to close selected UI

SettingsName_KeyChoice: Key Choice

KeyChoices_InventoryKey: Inventory Key
KeyChoices_CustomKey: Custom Key
KeyChoices_SelectKey: Select Key

SettingsDescription_KeyChoice: |-
  - {KeyChoices_InventoryKey}: Use the key you use to open the inventory.
  - {KeyChoices_CustomKey}: Use the custom key. Must set {SettingsName_CustomKey} or this will do nothing.
  - {KeyChoices_SelectKey}: Use the key selected in {SettingsName_SelectKey} setting. Some keys can't be set in {SettingsName_CustomKey} or don't work as {KeyChoices_InventoryKey}, so you can use this option instead.

SettingsName_SelectKey: Select Key
SettingsDescription_SelectKey: Must set {SettingsName_KeyChoice} to {KeyChoices_SelectKey} for this key to be used.

SettingsName_CustomKey: Custom Key
SettingsDescription_CustomKey: Must set {SettingsName_KeyChoice} to {KeyChoices_CustomKey} for this key to be used.
KeyDesciption_CustomKey: Force closes select UI

SettingsName_OnRelease: On Release
SettingsDescription_OnRelease: If true, will trigger UI close on key release instead of on press.

SectionName_UI: UI
SectionDescription_UI: |-
  - Select UI mode to close when you press the chosen key in the {SectionName_CloseKey} section.
  - OpenMW 4.9 API does not allow for detecting what window is open, but does allow for detecting what mode is. The "Interface" mode includes the inventory window.
    - So if "Interface" is set to true, and the close key is pressed, the interface mode will close if its open (which includes the inventory window).

# You can overwrite the name of any UI setting by placing it here: Just prefix it with "SettingsUI_"
# Example: 
# SettingsUI_Interface: Interface

# Overwriting the SelectKey options is not currently supported.
